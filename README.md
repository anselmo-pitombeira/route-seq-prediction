# Route Sequence Prediction

Source code used by Team Fortaleza in the **Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge**, supported by the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics.

Given real data on route sequences generated by drivers, the objective of the challenge was to develop a model which could predict route sequences from data on stops and packages to be delivered. our proposed solution uses a formulation of the problem as an **inverse reinforcement learning problem** and applies **Bayesian optimization** to train parameters of an embedded route sequence prediction algorithm.

# Route Sequence Prediction

Source code used by Team Fortaleza in the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge, supported by the MIT Centerfor Transportation and Logistics.

The proposed solution uses a formulation of the problem as an inverse reinforcement learning problem and applies Bayesian optimization to train parameters of the an embedded route sequence prediction algorithm.
